Hive is a Linux-first desktop music player built around your local library. It combines native GStreamer playback with a focused Electron interface for large collections, embedded metadata, artwork, playlists, queue management, and library tools.

## Built for your library

Hive is designed around the idea that your music library should remain useful outside of any one application.

- **Native GStreamer playback** — local playback with gapless support and ReplayGain-aware behavior.
- **Embedded metadata** — Favorites, ratings, and tags are written to the music files through Hive's bundled Mutagen backend.
- **Large-library management** — scanning, MusicBrainz-assisted matching, artwork lookup, and library organization.
- **Playlists & queue** — persistent playlists, queue management, and Favorites as a first-class library view.
- **Full tag editor** — individual and bulk metadata editing, artwork, lyrics, and advanced fields.
- **Yearly Wrap** — private, local listening statistics with MusicBee Wrapped archive import.
- **Portable by design** — the application, settings, and library database can live together in one folder, including on a removable drive.
- **Local-first privacy** — your library data and listening history stay local unless you explicitly use an optional integration.

## See Hive in action

### Favorites

Hive treats Favorites as part of the library itself, with the same browsing and playback workflow as the rest of your collection.

### Library statistics

Browse listening history and library activity through dedicated views such as Top 25 Most Played.

### Tag editing

Edit track metadata without leaving the player, including album information, ratings, comments, artwork, lyrics, and other fields.

### Themes & appearance

Customize Hive's visual treatment, including Frosted Glass surfaces and the application's overall theme.

### Yearly Wrap

Hive can turn its local play history into a private yearly listening summary.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chasesfloorboard/Hive/releases) page, extract it, and run:

```bash
tar -xzf Hive-*.tar.gz
cd Hive
./install.sh
```

The installer sets up Hive's dependencies, Electron runtime, native GStreamer helper, desktop entry, and MPRIS integration.

### Windows

Download `Hive-<version>-Win-x64.zip`, extract it, and run `Hive\Hive.exe`. Nothing else to install: the zip includes Hive's audio engine (GStreamer) and Python. Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.

On Windows, Hive plays MP3, FLAC, AAC/M4A, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, WavPack, WAV and AIFF. ALAC and WMA files are not supported yet. Linux-only features (bit-perfect output, output-device selection, MPRIS, Android sync) are not available.

The build is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn the first time: choose **More info → Run anyway**. Maintainers build the zip on Linux with `scripts/build-windows.sh`.

### Portable mode

Hive can run as a self-contained portable installation. Keep the whole Hive folder together and it stores its application data in `Hive Data/` beside the installation.

This makes it possible to keep Hive and a music library together on an external or removable drive.

## Requirements

These are for the Linux build; the Windows zip is self-contained.

- Linux
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3
- GStreamer 1.0 development/runtime packages
- A C compiler
- `ffmpeg`
- `metaflac` for applicable metadata formats

## Development

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm run check
npm start
```

Automated tests use controlled test data; Hive does not need access to a developer's real music library to run the test suite.

## Safety & data ownership

Hive is intentionally local-first:

- GStreamer is the sole native playback owner.
- Embedded metadata is authoritative for Favorites/Love.
- Metadata jobs are journaled and verified after writes.
- Metadata and artwork writes are restricted to configured library folders.
- The renderer uses context isolation and a narrow preload bridge.
- Crash reporting is local-only.
- Updates are checked and installed only with user consent.
