# game. Keep one stable Linux executable path and point its resources at the
# current build instead. The executable itself is hard-linked when possible so
# /proc/<pid>/exe remains the same path across builds.
#
# The stable binary is named "Hive", not "electron": Discord's own local game
# detection scans running executables, but a plain "electron" binary is
# indistinguishable from the dozens of unrelated non-game Electron apps
# (VS Code, Slack, Signal, Discord itself) that all ship one -- it was never
# offered as a detectable game because of that, even though the path itself
# was already stable. Electron resolves its own resources (locales/, *.pak,
# etc.) from the executable's directory, not its filename, so renaming just
# the binary is safe.
