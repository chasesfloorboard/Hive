// Canonical, stable home for ordinary local-playback user-volume tests. Edit
// this file in place when the volume architecture legitimately changes —
// this subsystem previously had 5+ separate buildNNN test files each pinned
// to one build's literal source text, none of which caught that the
// "direct apply" design they all asserted (builds 248-258) never actually
// stopped the audible popping a real user reported when dragging the
// slider. See CHANGELOG.md builds 193/239/241/246-258 for the history.
//
// Current architecture: ordinary user volume is a real in-pipeline
// GStreamer "volume" element ("hive-user-volume") in its own audio-sink bin,
// immediately upstream of the real sink. Builds 259-260 tried ramping this
// element (linear, then cubic-monotonic, via GstController) and reverted
// both as "subtly audible" -- but those sessions ran in a sandboxed
// container with no real audio hardware to actually validate that claim on
// (see CLAUDE.md). The important latency fix remains the element's placement
// after playbin's internal queue. Startup, unmuting, and transport
// transitions all still use the direct (unramped) setter.
//
// The slider ramp itself went through two more iterations after that,
// BOTH validated against real hardware/ears this time (not sandboxed):
// 1. A GstPadProbe-driven ramp that set the element's "volume" property once
//    per buffer -- fixed the original external-timer version's wasted writes
//    (see the buffer-boundary-quantization test below), but pops were STILL
//    audible on real hardware.
// 2. Root cause: setting the property once per buffer makes every sample
//    WITHIN that buffer share one flat gain -- a staircase with as many
//    steps as there are buffers in the ramp window, which decoders handing
//    off large frames (a FLAC block can be ~90ms) can reduce to a single
//    step, indistinguishable from an instant jump. Fixed by ramping at the
//    SAMPLE level: while a ramp is active, the element's own property is
//    forced to a 1.0 pass-through and volume_ramp_probe_cb applies a
//    smoothly interpolated gain directly to each buffer's raw PCM samples
//    (see apply_sample_ramp), continuous regardless of buffer size. The
//    property becomes authoritative again the instant the ramp ends.
//
// ReplayGain remains on its separate "hive-track-gain" element upstream in
// playbin's audio-filter chain.
